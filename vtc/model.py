"""The bitrate / quality model — the heart of the tool.

A tier is a fixed quality *density* (bits per pixel per frame), anchored to an
H.264 bitrate at 1080p/30fps. Targets scale with a file's actual pixels and frame
rate, so one tier covers SD -> 8K at any fps. The target is ABSOLUTE (a function
of the tier and the source's pixels/fps), never a fraction of the source's
current bitrate — which is what makes re-runs converge instead of shaving a file
smaller every pass.

See docs/quality-model.md for the full rationale. This module is pure (no I/O),
so it is trivially testable and shared by the CLI and the GUI.

    The cap is on the frame's SHORT EDGE, which is what "1080p" names. For any
    landscape source — every film and TV episode — the short edge IS the height,
    so this is exactly "cap the rows of the frame". For a portrait source it is
    the width instead, because a phone video 1080 across is what everyone calls
    1080p; measuring its 1920 rows against a 1080 cap would squeeze it to 608
    wide, which is not what the setting promises. The aspect ratio is always
    preserved, and `width`/`height` are DISPLAY dimensions (see
    MediaInfo.display_width) — a rotated file is judged on the picture, not on
    the axis it happens to be stored along.

    None means "encode the frame exactly as it is": the cap is off, the geometry
    is unknown, or the source is already at or below it. Nothing is ever
    upscaled, so a cap can only ever remove pixels.

    Both returned dimensions are EVEN. H.264/H.265 in yuv420p subsample chroma
    2x2, so an odd dimension is either rejected outright or quietly padded — and
    an odd *cap* (a hand-typed 1081) would take the encoder with it, which is why
    the cap itself is rounded down before anything is scaled to it.

    Both axes scale by the same factor and the sample aspect ratio is passed
    through untouched, so an anamorphic source keeps its display shape.
