"""Drive the real Advanced-settings UI in a DOM and check it does what it says.

The page is loaded exactly as shipped, then the controls are operated the way a
person operates them — type in the box, click the toggle — and the state handed
to the engine is read back. Pairs with tests/test_advanced_labels.py, which takes
that state and proves the engine then behaves as the label promised.

Needs node + jsdom (`cd tests/ui && npm install jsdom`); skipped without them, so
a plain `pytest tests/` on a machine with no node still passes.
