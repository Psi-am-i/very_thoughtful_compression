"""Tests for both ways of stopping a run.

STOP (graceful) — start no further files, let the ones in flight finish. The
original regression: with jobs=1 every file is submitted to the pool up front, so
guarding only the submit loop stopped nothing. The guard lives inside each work
unit instead. Note how many files that lets through depends on `jobs` — with two
workers, two files finish, which is what made it look like Stop was ignored.

ABORT (immediate) — kill the encodes where they stand. Killing the running ffmpeg
is not sufficient on its own: an encode is a ladder of attempts, so a killed one
looks like a failed one and the next rung starts a fresh ffmpeg. A latch in
encode.py makes the rest of the ladder fail fast, and the cancelled file is
dropped rather than reported as an error.

These run REAL software encodes, so they need ffmpeg; they skip cleanly without.

Run:  python tests/test_stop.py   |   pytest tests/test_stop.py
